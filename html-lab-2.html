  <p><i>This year’s Diwali brought in new hopes for the people of India</i>. As the country is still recovering from the devastating second wave of the Covid pandemic, new vaccines and fewer cases have strengthened India’s fight against the disease. India’s economy, which contracted by 7.3 per cent due to the Covid-19 pandemic, too, looks to be <b>on the rise with a growth projection of 9.5 per cent in 2021</b>, as businessmen across the country hope for a healthy festive season.</p>
